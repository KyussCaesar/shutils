# Find and open files for editing.
#
# Usage: edit [ --find | --grep ] <names...> [ '--' <options...> ]
#
# The --find/--grep flags set the search mode, which is used to select files:
#
#   --find: use `find . -name <name>` to select files. This is the default.
#   --grep: use `rg --files-with-matches <name>` to select files.
#
# For each name, use the search method to select files.
# The complete list of files is passed to your $EDITOR.
# If $EDITOR is not set, uses one of vim, nano, vi, ed; whichever can be found
# first.
#
# Any options (arguments after `--`) will be forwarded to the editor which is used.


# Examples:
#
#   BASIC USAGE:
#
#   # find all files called 'foobar.cfg', and open them with the default editor.
#   edit foobar.cfg
#
#   # find all files containing the pattern 'hello world', and open them with the default editor.
#   edit --grep 'hello world'
#
#
#   FORCING A SPECIFIC EDITOR TO BE USED:
#
#   # find all files called 'foobar.cfg', and ensure they are opened with vim.
#   EDITOR=vim edit 'foobar.cfg'
#
#
#   PASSING OPTIONS TO THE EDITOR
#
#   # find all files called 'baz', and open them with nano.
#   # also provide the -m switch to nano, which enabled mouse support.
#   EDITOR=nano edit baz -- -m
#
#
#   ADVANCED USAGE
#
#   # find all files that define a Python function called `frobinate`.
#   # open the files in vim, in vertical splits
#   EDITOR=vim edit --grep 'def frobinate\(' -- -O

set -e

# uses the users $EDITOR, if set.
# otherwise, will use one of vim, nano, vi, ed; whichever is found first.
